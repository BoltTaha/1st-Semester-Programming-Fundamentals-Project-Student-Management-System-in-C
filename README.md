# Student Management System in C ðŸŽ“

## Overview
This project, **Student Management System in C**, is developed as part of the 1st Semester Programming Fundamentals course. It focuses on implementing fundamental concepts of the C programming language and advanced file handling techniques to manage student data efficiently.

## Features
- **Student Data Management**: Allows storing and managing student records including details like name, roll number, marks, etc.
- **File Handling**: Implements advanced file handling techniques to read from and write to files, ensuring persistent storage of student information.
- **User Interface**: Basic command-line interface (CLI) for interaction, providing functionalities to add, modify, delete, and display student records.

## Implementation Details
- **Language**: Implemented in C.
- **File Handling**: Uses intensive file operations for student record maintenance.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into modules for data handling, file operations, and user interface to ensure scalability.

## Cloning the Repository
To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Taha-jamil/1st-Semester-Programming-Fundamentals-Project-Student-Management-System-in-C.git
```

## Usage
1. **Compilation**: Compile the `main.c` file using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o student_mgmt
   ```
   
2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable.
   ```bash
   ./student_mgmt
   ```
   
3. **Functionality**: Follow the command-line prompts to perform operations such as adding, modifying, deleting, and displaying student records.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement search functionality to retrieve specific student records.
- Add sorting capabilities based on different criteria (e.g., roll number, marks).
- Enhance user interface for better usability and experience.
